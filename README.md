# Quiz App

## Goals:

1. To build an all-round quiz app which lets you attempt quiz and create quiz.
2. My main focus was to try different ways i can write code while not worrying about how it would look.
3. Keep it minimal as possible.
4. Style using vanilla CSS.
5. Deploy frontend on netlify and backend on heroku using different deployment methods.

## Process

1. I created a mockup of all the pages in my notebook and roughly how they would look.
2. Started with creating static elements and made it dynamic while connecting with backend.
3. I honestly didn't care about Error boundaries initially but as I progressed further into the project, I realised it was very crucial.
4. Styled everything later when the skeleton was working the way I wanted.
5. Major focus while styling the elements was to make it look minimal but pleasing to eye(took some UI/UX pills from instagram)
6. Deployed the frontend on Netlify using Github as CI?CD pipeline.
7. I still want to make some changes, let's see.

## Challenges

1. I earlier hurdles whiles working with forms but cleared after a lot of tinkering and a bit of internet help.
2. State management was an issue and I used Context API for it, could have used Redux as well.
3. Setting up error boundaries was neglected initially that pushed me into the mud later but made my way anyhow.
4. While deploying I had to juggle whether to use environment variables or not as I stuck at an error due to a spelling mistake (Shame).
